# PWM-based-signal-generator

Here, a sine ware generator based on PWM of an Arduino is described. Almost no additional hardware is required (except for some resistances and capacitors to build a low pass filter). The tested signal frequence is from 20Hz to 1kHz. Several signals can be also synthesized.
